# PD-Selector
An Exploration: A Clustering Algorithm Capable of Participating in Backpropagation.

*This is a clustering algorithm capable of participating in backpropagation. In application, it can replace one-hot encoding and only requires knowledge of the similarity relationship between samples to train the model. There is also room for improvement in this structure.*
